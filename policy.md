## 1 INTRODUCTION

- 1. This section replicates the statutory requirements of the Prescribed NPO Order using paraphrased wording.

## 1.1 Prescribed Non-Profit Organisations

- 2. Prescribed NPOs are supervised persons under Article 1 of the Supervisory Bodies Law. They are subject to oversight and monitoring by the JFSC for compliance with the Prescribed NPO Order.
- 3. Prescribed NPOs is a sub-section of the non-profit sector which has been identified as being at a heightened risk and vulnerability of being abused for terrorist financing purposes.
- 4. Article 1 of the Prescribed NPO Order advises that a NPO will be considered a Prescribed NPO where, during the preceding 12 months it has:
> raised NPO Funds exceeding £1,000 from outside Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, England and Wales and Scotland, or
> disbursed NPO Funds exceeding £1,000 outside those jurisdictions.

For further guidance as to whether you are a Prescribed NPO see our website: Link

- 5. The JFSC will apply a risk-based approach to determine how a Prescribed NPO is overseen and monitored for compliance with the Prescribed NPO Order and the NPO Handbook. See the NPO section of our website for more details.

- 6. Prescribed NPOs are required by the Prescribed NPO Order to:

   › Article 2 - prepare an annual financial statement, and make it available to the JFSC upon request

  › Article 3 - have appropriate systems and controls to ensure that NPO Funds are fully accounted for

   › Article 4 - keep records of NPO Owners and/or Controllers sufficient to identify them

   › Article 5 - keep records of significant donor s and

   › Article 6 - take reasonable steps to identify, obtain information on, and confirm that its associate NPO s and NPO Beneficiaries are not assisting, or being used to assist, terrorist activities.

- 7. Parts of this section headed ' Statutory Requirements ' and ' NPO Codes of Practice ' are mandatory and Prescribed NPOs are required to comply with them. Parts of this section headed ' Guidance notes ' are not mandatory. Instead, they provide examples of how Prescribed NPOs might demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the Prescribed NPO Order and NPO Codes of Practice herein. The Guidance notes may also be beneficial for NPOs that are not classed as Prescribed NPOs.

- 8. Unless otherwise stated the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice set out in the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook (i.e., the Handbook that applies to the financial services businesses), do not apply to Prescribed NPOs.

- 9. Prescribed NPOs need to apply the requirements of the Prescribed NPO Order and the NPO Handbook to all their relationships with NPO Beneficiaries and associate NPOs, not just to those which are connected to higher risk jurisdictions.

- 10. Other acceptable methods of complying with the Prescribed NPO Order and NPO Codes of Practice, outside those described in the Guidance notes, may be possible provided they are equally as robust in demonstrating compliance with the mandatory requirements.
- 11. A Prescribed NPO should apply a risk-based approach to determine what kind of measures might be appropriate to demonstrate compliance with the Prescribed NPO Order and NPO Codes of Practice.
- 12. Whether any measure outside those described in the Guidance notes is in compliance with the mandatory requirements will be determined on a case-by-case basis. A Prescribed NPO will be expected to demonstrate how the measure applied is equally as robust. This may be facilitated, for example, by documenting how the specific measure meets the requirements of the Prescribed NPO Order and NPO Codes of Practice.

## 1.2 Objectives of the NPO Handbook

- 13. The objectives of this Handbook are:
> - to outline the relevant requirements of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation
> - to set out the JFSC's requirements, expressed as NPO Codes of Practice - to be followed by all Prescribed NPOs
> -    to assist Prescribed NPOs to comply with the requirements of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation and the NPO Codes of Practice, through practical interpretation
> -   to outline good practice in developing systems and controls to prevent Prescribed NPOs from being used to facilitate the financing of terrorism
> -   to provide a base from which Prescribed NPOs can design and implement systems and controls, and tailor their own policies and procedures, for the prevention and detection of the financing of terrorism
> -   to ensure that Jersey meets with international standards to prevent and the financing of terrorism
> -   to emphasise the responsibilities of the board and senior management of a Prescribed NPO (or their equivalent) in preventing and detecting the financing of terrorism
> -   to emphasise the particulars the financing of terrorism risks of Prescribed NPOs
> -   to provide an information resource to be used in training and raising awareness of the financing of terrorism.
- 14. This NPO Handbook will be reviewed on a regular basis and, where necessary following consultation, amended considering experience, changes in legislation, and the development of international standards.
- 15. This NPO Handbook is intended to be used by NPOs in the development of a Prescribed NPO's systems and controls, and detailed policies and procedures. Each Prescribed NPO is expected to draw up its own policies and procedures based on the guidance set out in this NPO Handbook. These policies and procedures will also help senior management and staff to comply with their obligations under Counter-Terrorism Legislation. This NPO Handbook is not intended to be used by Prescribed NPOs as an internal procedures' manual, instead the Prescribed NPO is expected to draft its own bespoke policies and procedures, in line with the scope and scale of its organisation, activities and risk exposure.

16. Prescribed NPOs are expected to think about how they might be vulnerable to and exploited by terrorists. The Counter-Terrorism Legislation expects Prescribed NPOs to consider and effectively manage the risks of being abused by terrorists and their associates, and to document how they are managing those risks.

## 1.3 Structure of the NPO Handbook

| Statutory requirements  [they may be  paraphrased in the NPO  Handbook] | Describe the statutory provisions that  must be complied with by a  Prescribed  NPO, in particular requirements set out in  the  Prescribed NPO Order and the NPO  Law. Some statutory requirements place  obligations on individuals. Failure to  follow a Statutory Requirement is a  criminal offence and may also attract  regulatory sanction. | The provisions of the  statutory  requirements and of  the  NPO Codes of  Practice  are described  using the term  must,  indicating that these  requirements are  mandatory for  Prescribed NPOs. |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| NPO Codes of Practice                                        | Set out principles and detailed  requirements for compliance with  statutory requirements, failure to follow  NPO Codes of Practice  may attract  regulatory sanction. The  NPO Codes of  Practice  comprise several individual  elements:  › to be followed in the area of  governance which must be in place for a  Prescribed NPO  to complyand  › explain in more detail how a  statutory requirement is to be complied  with. |                                                              |
| Guidance Notes                                               | Present ways of complying with the  statutory requirements and  NPO Codes of  Practice  and must always be read in  conjunction with these. A  Prescribed NPO may adopt other measures to those set  out in the  Guidance notes, including  (where applicable)  policies and  procedures  established by a group that it  is part of, so long as it can demonstrate  that such measures also achieve  compliance. This allows a  Prescribed  NPO ' s  discretion as to how to apply  requirements in the particular  circumstances of its activities and related  parties. ~~The soundly reasoned application  of the provisions contained within the  Guidance notes  will provide a good  indication that a  Prescribed NPO  is in  compliance with the statutory  requirements and NPO Codes of Practice.~~ | Guidance notes  use  the term  may, indicating ways in  which the  requirements may be  satisfied, but allowing  for alternative means  of meeting the  statutory  requirements or  NPO  Codes of Practice. |
| Overview text                                                | Provide broader context relevant to  particular sections or sub-sections of the  NPO Handbook. |                                                              |

- 17. In exceptional circumstances, where strict adherence to any of the NPO Codes of Practice would produce an anomalous result, a Prescribed NPO may apply in advance in writing to the JFSC for a variance from the particular requirement see Section 1.3

## 1.4 Legal Status -NPO Handbook and NPO Codes of Practice

## Statutory Requirements

<!--
rule_type: statutory
applies_to: prescribed_npo
-->


- 18. NPOs are subject to the Non-Profit Organizations (Jersey) Law 2008 (NPO Law). NPOs are defined in Article 1 of the NPO Law as:
- (1) An organization, legal person or arrangement is a non-profit organization for the purposes of this Law if -
- (a) it is established solely or primarily for charitable, religious, cultural, educational, social, or fraternal purposes with the intention of benefiting the public or a section of the public; and
- (b) it raises or disburses funds in pursuance of those purposes. [1]
- (2) In paragraph (1) 'organization' includes the trustees of a trust. [2]
- (3) The States may amend this Article by Regulations.
- 19. Non-Profit Organizations if they meet the definition above are required to register with the JFSC under Articles 6 and 7 of the NPO Law and supply information and documents to enable the JFSC to assess the extent (if any) to which the NPO/ proposed NPO is assisting or being used to assist terrorism or the financing of terrorism or is likely to assist or be used to assist terrorism or the financing of terrorism.

- 20. The JFSC may refuse to register an NPO under Article 8 if the JFSC is of the opinion that:
> the NPO/proposed NPO is assisting or being used to assist terrorism or the financing of terrorism or is likely to assist or be used to assist terrorism or the financing of terrorism,; or
> the organization does not/will not meet the NPO definition.

Any refusal to register the NPO is subject to a right of appeal as set out in Article 8.

- 21. There is an Order that sets out requirements in relation to NPOs: Non-Profit Organisations (Prescribed NPOs -Additional Obligations) (Jersey) Order 2022 (Prescribed NPO Order).
- 22. Prescribed NPOs are supervised persons under Article 1 of the Proceeds of Crime (Supervisory Bodies) (Jersey) Law 2008 (Supervisory Bodies Law). They are therefore subject to oversight and monitoring by the JFSC for compliance with the Prescribed NPO Order.
- 23. The JFSC exercises a supervisory function to monitor and oversee compliance of a supervised person that is a NPO with the NPO Law or an Order made under Article 13A of that Law (the Supervisory Bodies Law) Article 2 (a) (vi))
- 24. Article 13A of the NPO Order the Minister may impose obligations on Prescribed NPOs or a NPO that belongs to a prescribed class of NPOs. The Minister may not impose an obligation unless it relates to a measure recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in its interpretative note to FATF's Recommendation 8, as amended from time to time.
- 25. Article 22 of the Supervisory Bodies Law allows the JFSC, after consultation with relevant persons/bodies who are representative of interests concerned, to prepare, issue and revise Codes of Practice. Codes of Practice set out the principles and detailed requirements that must be complied with to meet certain requirements of the Supervisory Bodies Law, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism legislation and the NPO Law, or an Order made under Article 14A of the NPO Law.
- 26. Codes of Practice may apply to any category, class or description of supervised business (Supervisory Bodies Law, Article 22 (1) (c) and Article 22 (3)).
- 27. This NPO Handbook is issued by the JFSC, pursuant to its powers under Article 8 of the Financial Services Commission (Jersey) Law 1998 in accordance with Article 22 of the Supervisory Bodies Law, which provides for Codes of Practice to be prepared and issued for the purpose of setting out principles and detailed requirements.
- 28. The NPO Codes of Practice in this NPO Handbook are applicable to all Prescribed NPOs.
- 29. The NPO Codes of Practice set out the principles and detailed requirements that must be complied with to meet certain statutory provisions of the Supervisory Bodies Law and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation (Proceeds of Crime Law, Terrorism Law, Directions Law, Targeted Financial Sanctions Measures) by Prescribed NPOs. The NPO Codes of Practice comprise several individual NPO Codes of Practice.

## 1.5 JFSC's Role - Monitoring/Oversight
<!--
rule_type: statutory
applies_to: prescribed_npo
-->

- 30. Under Article 17 of the NPO Law, the JFSC:
- (i) is obliged to consider if (upon receiving an application) it raises any suspicion that an existing NPO or proposed NPO undergoing registration is assisting, or being used to assist, terrorism or the financing of terrorism, or is likely to assist, or be used to assist, terrorism or the financing of terrorism  and

- (ii) may also use other methods of monitoring NPO activity. When in receipt of any information, including financial statements relating to an NPO, the JFSC considers any potential financing of terrorism risks).

-->
- 31. Guidance on when registration as non-profit organization is set out on our website: Link
- 32. The JFSC is designated under Article 6 of the Supervisory Bodies Law to exercise supervisory functions in respect of any other person carrying on a supervised business. For the non-profit sector this means the JFSC exercising risk-based monitoring or oversight over Prescribed NPOs.
- 33. Article 8A(3) of the Supervisory Bodies La w requires the JFSC to take account of FATF Recommendations when devising a risk profile for the Prescribed NPO.
- 34. Compliance with the NPO Codes of Practice will be considered by the JFSC in the conduct of its oversight and monitoring programme, including on-site assessments.
- 35. Prescribed NPOs may get a visit from the JFSC to carry out oversight or monitoring. Further information related to such examinations can be found on the JFSC's website. In certain circumstances, the JFSC may also serve a notice on a Prescribed NPO which would require, among other things, senior management (or their equivalent) to attend interviews and to answer questions and/or provide information and documents.
- 36. The JFSC has the powers to proactively oversee or monitor those NPOs that fall within the definition of a Prescribed NPO, using a risk-based approach. Examples of measures that could be applied to NPOs, in whole or in part, depending on the risk identified, are:
- i) Article 4 of the NPO Law, all NPOs or proposed NPOs, that are established or administered in Jersey, must be registered with the JFSC. This information is available to competent authorities. The NPO register in Jersey is not available to the public, but the JFSC provides confirmation of registration in response to public queries.
- ii) Article 7 of the NPO Law, NPOs have an obligation to provide the JFSC with further information and documents, if required, by the JFSC to enable it to assess TF risk
- iii) Article 9 of the NPO Law, NPOs have an obligation to  give the JFSC notice of change of registered information within 3 months of the change, including any change in the estimate of the funds to be raised or disbursed by the NPO in any subsequent financial year.
- iv) Article 10 of the NPO Law, all NPOs must keep their financial records and retain them for at least 5 years.
- v) Article 13 of the NPO Law, NPOs must, upon being requested to do so, provide a person with details of its purpose, objectives and intended activities; and details of its structure.
- vi) Article 13A of NPO Law, additional obligations are imposed on a Prescribed NPO, or a NPO that belongs to a prescribed class of NPOs, to reduce their risk of being used to assist terrorism or the financing of terrorism or becoming likely to assist or be used to assist terrorism or the financing of terrorism, in line with the FATF's Recommendation 8:
> *obligation to prepare annual financial statement;
> *obligation to have appropriate accounting systems and controls;
> *obligation to keep records of owners, controllers etc.;
> *obligation to keep record of significant donors;
> *obligations to identify its associate NPOs and beneficiaries, to obtain information about their activities and the nature and purpose of its relationship with them, to confirm that they are not assisting or being used to assist terrorism or the financing of terrorism.
- 37. Each Prescribed NPO in Jersey must recognise the role that it must play in protecting itself, its staff, employees and volunteers from involvement in the financing of terrorism and in protecting the Island's reputation including the trust of the donor community.
- 38. The JFSC strongly believes that the key to the prevention and detection of the financing of terrorism, lies in the implementation of, and strict adherence to, effective systems and controls, based on international standards. The NPO Handbook therefore establishes standards which match international standards issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The NPO Handbook takes account of the requirements of EU legislation to the financing of terrorism and its application of standards set by the FATF.

## 1.6 Consequences of Non-Compliance
<!--
rule_type: statutory
applies_to: prescribed_npo
-->
## Statutory requirements (paraphrased)

- 39. Prescribed NPOs are 'supervised persons' under the Supervisory Bodies Law that provides the JFSC with the same dissuasive sanctions and supervisory powers across all sectors of its AML/CFT/CPF supervisory regime.
- 40. Under Article 8 of the Supervisory Bodies Law, the JFSC has the power: 'to do anything (a) that is calculated to facilitate; or(b) that is incidental or conducive to, the performance of any of its functions' under that law.
- 41. That power includes a general power to assess Prescribed NPO's conducting reasonable routine examinations of a supervised person in relation to whom the supervisory body exercises supervisory functions.
- 42. There is also a range of offences set out under Part 4 of the NPO Law where the penalty is a fine. Under Article 34 of the NPO Law, a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence under the NPO Law is also guilty of an offence and liable to the same manner as a principal offender to the penalty.
- 43. Prescribed NPOs are at higher risk of being abused, directly or indirectly for TF purposes and therefore the sanctions, in the Supervisory Bodies Law reflect the requirement for a range of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions measures that can be applied dependent on the severity of the contravention.
<!--
rule_type: general_info

-->
- 44. Where a breach of an NPO Code of Practice results in contravention of the NPO Order a supervised person and its employees (paid, unpaid and volunteers) can be criminally prosecute.

## 2 VULNERABILITIES OF PRESCRIBED NPOS

## Overview

> - 1. The April 2022 the National Risk Assessment for NPOs (the NPO NRA) identified around 11% of Jersey-based NPOs as being particularly vulnerable to being abused for terrorist financing purposes.
> - 2. This sub-sector of NPOs may be more vulnerable to terrorist financing abuse due to one or more of the following factors:

> operating in higher-risk jurisdictions, such as conflict zones, failed states and disaster areas, where support such as humanitarian aid and disaster relief is desperately needed, and which equally are areas where terrorists also are known to undertake activities;
> using associate NPOs ;
> using money remittance methods, such as Hawala and cash, which may render the tracing of funds to legitimate NPO Beneficiaries more challenging.
- 3. Diversion is the principal way in which NPOs may be abused for terrorist financing. The Glossary of the NPO Handbook defines Diversion as ' transactions by NPO Representatives or external parties such as associate NPOs that divert funds away from the NPO's legitimately intended purposes to a terrorist, terrorist cell or terrorist organisation for them to benefit from, directly or indirectly'.
- 4. The Financial Action Task Force has described the likelihood of Diversion as being dependent on three factors:
- 5. This means that the closeness of a terrorist actor to the NPO and its NPO programme plays a part. It explains why some countries, jurisdictions and areas, as well as the areas adjacent to them, are treated as being more exposed to terrorist financing risk than others. Equally, if the NPO has access to resources that the terrorist actor values, this brings heightened risk. The terrorist actor must also have both the intent and capability to take advantage of the NPO.
- 6. Examples of how Diversion may take place include:
> - terrorist s posing as legitimate NPO Beneficiaries to benefit from NPO programmes, such as receiving NPO Funds ;
> - terrorist s appearing to act as ordinary associate NPOs, at the same time as abusing NPO Resources by diverting NPO Funds to support their activities.
- 7. Diversion risk may increase where an NPO:
> - does not properly invest in its terrorist financing risk control framework on grounds of cost;
> - is too focused on assisting NPO Beneficiaries at the expense of accountability or effective risk management;
> - has a high-risk appetite, and a low level of terrorist financing risk controls;
> - takes the view that if no incidents are reported, or that the diverted value is small, the risk of terrorist financing abuse is negligible. It is worth reflecting that even when utilising small amounts, a bad actor can cause great harm. For example, the cost of assembling a dangerous homemade explosive device can require only a relatively small amount of funds.
- 8. Diversion risk can also increase where a NPO does not adequately manage ' Transfer risk ', i.e., the risk that Diversion will take place where funds are transferred to associate NPOs. High-quality associate NPOs can reduce terrorist financing risk, with their local knowledge and relationships providing an additional level of information and control to the NPO. However, poor due diligence can increase the terrorist financing risk. Some associate NPOs may be sympathetic to, infiltrated by, or under the control of, terrorist elements. Alternatively, they may not have strong terrorist financing controls and may inadvertently finance terrorist activities.
- 9. Ceding control of funds does not cede responsibility for their destination. Associate NPO selection, due diligence and oversight forms a crucial part of responsible NPO activity.
- 10. The offence of terrorist financing is broad in nature and scope. For the purposes of the NPO Handbook, it is defined as:
> Conduct which is an offence under any provision of Articles 15, 16 and 16A of the Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002 (the Terrorism Law);
> Conduct outside Jersey which, if occurring in Jersey, would be an offence under Articles 15, 16 and 16A of the Terrorism Law ;
> Conduct which is an offence under any provision of Article 21 of the Terrorism Law ;
> Conduct which is an offence under any provision of Parts 3, 4 and 6 of the Sanctions and Asset-Freezing Law.
- 11. Terrorist financing abuse may happen in numerous ways. For example, NPOs may be:
> A cover: This is when the NPO acts as a front, pretending to do good work. In reality, it funds terrorist activities. At times the donors are aware of this illicit purpose. In the case of the Benevolence International Foundation, the organisation contracted with Al Qaeda to provide support for an injured foreign terrorist fighter, whilst its documents made it look as if the aid was provided to an orphan. Front NPOs have been abused by organisations such as the Irish Republican Army, Al-Qaeda and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
> A conduit: This occurs when a NPO undertakes good work and, additionally, siphons off funds for terrorist activities. This can occur when the NPO:
- a. Is 'hijacked' by a bad actor, such as a staff member or volunteer who has influence over funds and who diverts them to a terrorist organisation, a terrorist cells or an individual terrorist. The siphoned off/diverted funds can then be used for terrorist causes such as to fund terrorist attacks, obtain weapons, and pay foreign terrorist fighters and their families;
- b. Does not have adequate procedures and is not undertaking due diligence on who it is collaborating with (a Partner) or who it pays its funds to (Beneficiaries). Partners may include, for example, other NPOs and charities that the NPO collaborates with locally, or its contractors, venders and suppliers, for example its security staff;
- c. Is pressed to pay a 'tribute', a fee or a tax, for its 'safe passage' to enter, pass through, operate in, and exit an area.

These tactics of abusing NPOs have been used by, for example, Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, Lashkar-eTayyaba, Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Al -Shabaab.

> A con: In this scenario, the NPO does not exist. Instead, bad actors pretend that they are raising funds for a legitimate NPO. They may for example wear charity T-shirts and raise funds through bucket collections. This tactic was used by the members of the Birmingham bomb plot.
- 12. Much diversion risk related to terrorist financing can be mitigated by good governance and robust policies and procedures. Such systems and controls are also beneficial to counter other forms of criminal activity, including money laundering and proliferation financing. Diversion displays similar characteristics as risks such as those related to bribery, corruption and fraud.

## 3 RISK-BASED APPROACH

## Statutory requirements (paraphrased wording)
<!--
rule_type: statutory
applies_to: prescribed_npo
-->
- 1. Article 6 of the Prescribed NPO Order requires a Prescribed NPO to take reasonable steps to:
- (a) identify its associate NPOs and NPO Beneficiaries
- (b) obtain information about:
> the activities of each associate NPO and NPO Beneficiary; and
> the nature and purpose of its relationship with each associate NPO and NPO Beneficiary; and
> confirm, so far as possible, that its associate NPOs and NPO Beneficiaries are not assisting or being used to assist terrorism or the financing of terrorism.

## 2. In Article 6:

- (a) 'associate NPO' means an NPO with which the Prescribed NPO collaborates or works jointly in carrying out its activities
- (b) 'beneficiary' means a person who receives assistance through the activities of the Prescribed NPO.

## 3.1 NPO programme risk assessment (NPO PRA) and associated activities
<!--
rule_type: code_of_practice
applies_to: prescribed_npo
-->
## NPO Codes of Practice

[NPO1] A Prescribed NPO must assess and mitigate the risk of being used to assist terrorism, or the financing of terrorists.

[NPO2] A Prescribed NPO must define and document their approach to Diversion risk in a risk appetite statement.

[NPO3] A Prescribed NPO must have internal systems and controls in place to mitigate Diversion risks.
<!--
rule_type: guidance
applies_to: all
-->
## Guidance notes

- 3. Prescribed NPOs are expected to apply enhanced controls to demonstrate that they are effectively identifying, assessing, managing, and mitigating terrorist financing risks. These risks may include, but are not limited to:
> operating in jurisdictions with higher terrorist financing risks, such as those identified in Appendix D2 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook, including, for example, conflict zones, failed states, and disaster areas;
> utilising certain payment remittance methods which fall outside the formal banking system, such as Hawala, mobile money, preloaded cards, virtual assets, cash (outside Jersey) etc.;
> funds being diverted from intended beneficiaries of the NPO programme to any other third party with weak terrorist financing controls.
- 4. A risk-based approach is not intended to prevent or obstruct aid from reaching legitimate NPO Beneficiaries. It is a way of ensuring it reaches them in the safest way. Transparency is critical for mitigating Diversion risk. Without assessing risk in a meaningful way, it is not possible to ascertain if the systems and controls in place are effective. Adequate systems and controls can also safeguard the non-profit sector, and Jersey, from reputational damage. Robust controls provide confidence to donors, Financial Institutions, such as banks, and the regulator. It can also mitigate civil litigation from donors.
- 5. A risk-based approach can be established through the completion of a NPO programme risk assessment (NPO PRA). These should be undertaken by the charity governors, board members, trustees, senior officers (or equivalent, whether or not they are remunerated). The NPO PRA should be:
> undertaken as soon as reasonably practicable before the NPO commences the programme; and
> recorded to assist the NPO in demonstrating its rationale.
- 6. Whilst it is the responsibility of each Prescribed NPO to identify and define their NPO programme(s) of activity, examples may include:
> the delivery of food parcels to rural communities in X country;
> providing emergency shelters and supplies to victims of an earthquake and tsunami in Y country;
> funding of an animal shelter in Z country.
- 7. A Prescribed NPO may consider it appropriate to conduct a separate risk assessment for each NPO programme of activity undertaken. This might be appropriate where only one NPO programme of activity is conducted at a time.
- 8. Where a Prescribed NPO undertakes a large number of NPO programmes simultaneously, e.g., aid operations in multiple countries, it may be more suitable to conduct one NPO PRA for the whole body of work conducted.
- 9. A NPO PRA should be reviewed at any point where there is a perceived change in the risk profile of the NPO programme(s) which have been assessed (e.g., if civil unrest develops in the region where the NPO programme is taking place).
- 10. The NPO PRA should have regard to all relevant risk factors. These may include, but are not limited to:
> the nature, scale, complexity and the diversity of its operations (including geographical diversity), the volume and size of its transactions, and the degree of risk associated with each area of its operation;
> jurisdictions, territories or areas where it is not uncommon that terrorist organisations may demand that people they direct should be involved in a NPO programme, for example where the terrorist s may be political actors, or where terrorist s otherwise control the area;
> operating in environments where gifts form part of cultural interactions, and where terrorist organisations may exert pressure to comply with such donations;
> operating in environments where taxes and fees are collected by terrorist organisations or their Sympathisers, and where this is a known and regular occurrence;
> location remoteness and intensity of local conflict and factions, potentially intensified by legitimate security and policing forces not having a presence;
> carrying out distribution work in jurisdictions, territories or areas that are controlled by terrorist organisations where the NPO may be directed or demanded to provide aid to certain parties;
> the characteristics of activities and services the NPO offers, and the associated vulnerabilities posed by each activity and service;
> any degree of third-party involvement in the NPO programme, including, for example, using associate NPOs ;
> jurisdictions, territories or areas where NPOs require the support of local associate NPOs to be able to operate safely and where terrorist organisations have political support and influence;
> circumstances where it is difficult to adequately screen a person's background or establish their associates;
> any risk presented by the Prescribed NPO 's donors or NPO Beneficiaries ;
> any risk presented by the technology utilised by the Prescribed NPO, including communications channels, fund-raising platforms and payment mechanisms;
> being the target of a cyber-attack, such as through phishing. An example of a cyber-attack might be where an attacker sends an e-mail to the Prescribed NPO, pretending to be from one of their suppliers. The e-mail includes an invoice and states that the supplier has changed their bank and requires the NPO to amend the account details of where to send payments. The invoice has been doctored, and the new account details are those of the attacker. The money is then transferred directly to the attacker, potentially for the benefit of terrorist s.
- 11. When conducting a NPO PRA care should be taken not to focus too much on any single factor. All aspects of the political, economic, geographical, technological, social and sanction risk environment in the area of the NPO's operations should be considered. Prescribed NPOs should also take into account any risks identified by a NPO NRA, or similar documents.
- 12. Risk should also be considered on a cumulative basis. The overall exposure from all risks aggregated together may be greater than if they were each considered individually.
- 13. An example of a NPO PRA checklist can be downloaded from our website and modified, as appropriate: draft programme risk assessment checklist.  This template is not intended to be rigid or prescriptive. An NPO may wish to make amendments to the checklist to account for the specific risks relevant to its activities.
- 14. To support the assessment of risks presented by a particular NPO programme of work, it may be appropriate to prepare a risk appetite statement. This statement sets out what level of terrorist financing risk the Prescribed NPO is prepared to tolerate. A clear position, set out in writing, can assist a Prescribed NPO in deciding whether a proposed NPO programme of work creates too much risk exposure to be undertaken.
- 15. It is our expectation that a risk appetite statement should confirm, at a minimum, that the Prescribed NPO will not tolerate Diversion, nor parties that enable Diversion. It may also consider and discuss:
> whether there are certain jurisdictions, territories or areas in which the NPO is comfortable to operate, such as where it has previous experience and is engaged with known associate NPO s. There may be other places where the NPO is unwilling to operate;
> if the Prescribed NPO will avoid certain routes or geographical areas, or particular relationships, or the use of certain payment methods (e.g., cash, pre-paid cards, Hawala, mobile money, virtual assets etc.);
> if working alongside certain associate NPO s falls outside the NPO 's risk appetite ;
> what contractual arrangements and terms it will be prepared to put in place working with an associate NPO, for example seeking undertakings of non-tolerance for Diversion ;
> what types of donors it will accept funding from;
> who it will distribute benefits to and where;
> certain conflict levels which it will not tolerate, such as delivering aid in an active warzone.
- 16. When preparing the NPO PRA and risk appetite statement, it is important to recognise that an NPO's risk management capabilities are not always transferrable from one NPO programme to another. If adequate safeguards cannot be put in place regarding a particular NPO programme, it should be considered whether another NPO, with greater capability, ought to carry out the NPO programme instead.
- 17. A Prescribed NPO may consider that it is able to establish a risk-based approach through methods other than conducting a NPO PRA, and/or risk appetite statement. In these circumstances, the Prescribed NPO is expected to demonstrate how its alternative measures achieve the same outcome as those set out above.

### CD Regulated TCSP Guidance

- 18. Where a Prescribed NPO is receiving services from a CD regulated TCSP, it may be appropriate for the CD regulated TCSP to add the output of the NPO PRA and risk appetite statement to their own BRA (see section 2.3.1 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook).
- 19. A CD regulated TCSP may also consider it appropriate to integrate any periodic testing of the Prescribed NPO's systems and controls into the testing undertaken for their TCSP business (see section 2.4.2 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook).

## 3.2 Prescribed NPOs solely remitting to charities in equivalent jurisdictions
<!--
rule_type: general_info
applies_to: all
-->
- 20. For guidance in terms of what is meant by an equivalent jurisdiction, see Appendix B of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook.


- 21. A number of NPOs established in Jersey conduct no activity apart from disbursing funds to charities which are operating in equivalent jurisdictions. Examples of this type of operating model include:
> a faith-based NPO sending funds to a larger faith-based organisation, based in an equivalent jurisdiction, which conducts mission activities across the world;
> a Jersey branch of a global aid organisation sending funds to its headquarters based in an equivalent jurisdiction.
- 22. When conducting their NPO PRA (or equivalent), Prescribed NPOs undertaking no activity apart from disbursing funds to charities which are operating in equivalent jurisdictions, should take into account the following factors:
> what jurisdictions does the recipient organisation operate in?
> how has the Prescribed NPO concluded that the country in which the recipient organisation operates is an equivalent jurisdiction (see sections 1.9.2, 1.9.3 and Appendix B of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook for further guidance)?
> will the funds sent by the Prescribed NPO be applied for a specific purpose, or does the recipient organisation have the freedom to apply the funds to whatever activities it sees fit?
> what assurances has the recipient organisation given in terms of their systems and controls to mitigate the risk of Diversion ?
- 23. Set out below is a case study demonstrating how a Prescribed NPO acting in this manner might carry out their NPO PRA (or equivalent):
> a Prescribed NPO has been established to raise funds in Jersey, in order to support a charity based abroad which rescues and rehomes stray dogs from across the world. That charity operates in a number of higher-risk jurisdictions for terrorist financing purposes as per Appendix D2 of the Handbook ;
> the Prescribed NPO sends NPO Funds to the charity with no caveats in terms of how it should be applied, and the charity is free to use the money as it chooses;
> the Prescribed NPO is aware of the risk that the NPO Funds they have donated may be diverted for terrorist financing purposes once they reach the higher-risk jurisdictions. Therefore, they ask the charity to provide details of their systems and controls to counter terrorist financing. This may include speaking with the charity's Head of CFT, reviewing their policy manual and finding out who their associate NPO s are. The Prescribed NPO may also consider the track record of the charity and their associate NPO s through a search for adverse news articles on Google or similar search engines. The Prescribed NPO may check that the charity remains in good standing with the regulator in the jurisdiction where the charity is supervised;
> after considering the above, the Governing body of the Prescribed NPO decides they are satisfied that the charity has sufficient controls to mitigate the risk of Diversion. The Prescribed NPO records their checks, and the rationale for their decision, in their NPO PRA and proceed to remit NPO Funds to the charity;
- 24. As part of their ongoing risk monitoring, the Governing body of the Prescribed NPO decides to check for adverse news articles on the charity via Google on an annual basis.

## 4 ONGOING RISK MONITORING
<!--
rule_type: general_info
applies_to: all
-->
25. Risk monitoring of a NPO programme is a dynamic and cyclical process. It ensures that any new risks are addressed as they arise and establishes how previously identified risks may have changed. The below diagram from the UK Charities Commission illustrates the risk assessment cycle:

## The risk assessment cycle

[placeholder]

26. A Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that terrorist financing risks are being monitored on an on-going basis by:

> ensuring that the identification, assessment, management and mitigation of risk is linked to the achievement of the Prescribed NPO 's operational objectives ;
> ensuring that the assessment process reflects the charity governors', b oard members', trustees', senior officers' (or equivalent, whether or not they are remunerated) view of acceptable risk;
> reviewing and considering the results of risk identification, evaluation and management;
> considering the risks attached to significant new activities or opportunities;
> considering external factors, such as new legislation, sanctions or regulations;
> considering the financial impact of risk as part of budget planning;
> documenting how the charity governor's, board member's, trustee's, senior officers (or equivalent, whether or not they are remunerated) have decided how the identified risks should be treated and managed.
- 27. A Prescribed NPO may demonstrate they are adequately monitoring risk by keeping records of their monitoring activities in a Diversion risk register. An example of a Diversion risk register can be downloaded from our website: draft Diversion risk register template.
- 28. This template is not intended to be rigid or prescriptive. A Prescribed NPO may decide, with reference to its NPO PRA and/or risk appetite statement (or equivalents) that it should carry out monitoring on more, less or different risks than those listed in the template Diversion risk register.
- 29. When completing the Diversion risk register, a Prescribed NPO should refer to their NPO PRA and/or risk appetite statement (or equivalents) to help them conclude the risk level of a particular area, and what controls should be put in place. For example:
> a risk area assessed as low risk may only need minimal controls;
> a risk area assessed as medium risk may need some additional controls; and
> a higher risk activity may need significant additional controls. If it is judged that the risk cannot be mitigated by the Prescribed NPO to an acceptable level, it would be appropriate to leave this work to another party that can effectively manage the risk.
- 30. It is recommended that a periodic review of a NPO's risks is conducted at least annually. Through the application of a risk-based approach, it can be determined whether certain risks should be monitored more or less frequently. For example:
> A Prescribed NPO whose sole activity is disbursing funds to a reputable charity which only carries out activity in an equivalent jurisdiction may only need to review their exposure to higher-risk jurisdictions on an annual basis; for example, by seeking confirmation from the overseas charity that it continues to only act within their home jurisdiction;
> If a Prescribed NPO is supporting displaced persons in a country undergoing civil conflict its activity is potentially exposed to the risk of being extorted for a portion of the NPO Funds to gain access to the NPO Beneficiaries. In this case it would be more appropriate to monitor the risk of association with a target of financial sanctions related to terrorism on a more regular basis at an interval that is appropriate in the circumstances, e.g., quarterly.
- 31. In all cases, the outcome of periodic reviews should be documented. A Prescribed NPO should be able to explain and justify why it has chosen to conduct its risk monitoring in a certain manner, and at a certain interval.

## 5.1 NPO Beneficiaries
<!--
rule_type: statutory
applies_to: prescribed_npo
-->

### Statutory requirements (paraphrased wording)

- 32. Article 6 of the Prescribed NPO Order requires a Prescribed NPO to take reasonable steps to:
- (a) identify its associate NPOs and NPO Beneficiaries
- (b) obtain information about:
- o the activities of each associate NPO and NPO Beneficiary; and
- o the nature and purpose of its relationship with each associate NPO and NPO Beneficiary; and
- (c) confirm, so far as possible, that its associate NPOs and NPO Beneficiaries are not assisting or being used to assist terrorism or the financing of terrorism.
<!--
rule_type: general_info
applies_to: all
-->
## Overview

- 33. NPO Beneficiaries are defined in the Glossary of this NPO Handbook. As noted, this term captures natural persons, as well as groups of natural persons.
- 34. For the purposes of the NPO Handbook, a Prescribed NPO establishes a relationship with an NPO Beneficiary.
- 35. To comply with the Prescribed NPO Order, a Prescribed NPO will need to apply a level of due diligence on its NPO Beneficiaries. The due diligence in this respect is not intended to follow that of financial services busines ses, since this would not be proportionate, nor appropriate. Instead, the NPO should identify its NPO Beneficiaries by applying a risk-based approach.
- 36. In the context of NPO Beneficiaries, a risk-based approach means applying sufficient measures, having regard to the NPO PRA and risk appetite statement (or equivalent documents), to be satisfied that the NPO Beneficiary is not involved in terrorism or terrorist financing. A higher level of risk may require more stringent measures to be applied, whilst a lower level of risk might require less.

## CD regulated TCSP guidance

- 37. Where a Prescribed NPO is receiving services from a CD regulated TCSP and it is considered appropriate to do so, the NPO may choose to apply due diligence measures which are aligned with those set out in sections 3 and 4 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook.

<!--
rule_type: guidance
applies_to: all
-->
## Guidance notes -Identifying NPO Beneficiaries

- 38. Where a NPO Beneficiary is a single person, a Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that it has taken reasonable measures to identify that person where it obtains the following information:
> Name;
> Date of birth (if possible);
> Country of birth;
> Current area of residence.


- 39. The amount of identity information requested may differ based on the outcome of the NPO PRA (or equivalent).
- 40. Identity information for an individual may be obtained directly from the NPO Beneficiary, or their representative.
- 41. Where a NPO Beneficiary is a group of persons, for example refugees from a particular conflict, there is no requirement to identify each individual person.
- 42. In these cases, the Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that is has taken reasonable measures to identify the group if the characteristics of that group are consistent with the purpose and objectives set out in the Prescribed NPO 's constitutional documents (or their equivalent).
- 43. For example, if the Prescribed NPO 's constitutional documents state that its objective is to provide humanitarian support to victims of conflict, this would be consistent with a group of NPO Beneficiaries who are a group of refugees from such conflicts.
- 44. However, the Prescribed NPO should be alive to the fact that different classes of NPO Beneficiaries will present different levels of risk from a terrorist financing perspective based on their location and proximity to terrorist organisations etc.
- 45. Identity information for a group of persons may be obtained from a representative of that group.

## Guidance notes -Nature and purpose of relationship with NPO Beneficiary

- 46. As part of its reasonable measures in respect of NPO Beneficiaries, a Prescribed NPO will need to obtain information on the nature and purpose of their relationship with the NPO Beneficiary. It should do this by requesting and documenting the information at the establishment of the relationship.
- 47. The 'nature' of a relationship may include:
> the amount and type of NPO Funds which would be applied to the NPO Beneficiary/(ies);
> whether any associate NPO s are involved, and their purpose.
- 48. The 'purpose' of a relationship may include:
> what the activity is aiming to achieve, such as building a pump to provide a rural community with access to clean water or distributing food to victims of a drought.

## Guidance notes -Confirming NPO Beneficiaries are not involved in terrorism

- 49. Where a NPO Beneficiary is a single person, a Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that it has taken reasonable measures to confirm that person is not assisting, or being used to assist, terrorism/the financing of terrorism, where it takes steps to ascertain whether the person is a legitimate NPO Beneficiary. Such steps may include:
> seeking a reference from an independent person to corroborate the information provided by or regarding the NPO Beneficiary. For example, if the NPO Beneficiary is a child staying in an orphanage, the reference should confirm that the child is in fact staying there;
> visiting the location where the NPO Funds will be applied to consider whether the amount(s) to be applied appear reasonable given what is proposed to be done with them;
> considering if the amount(s) to be applied to the NPO Beneficiary makes sense when compared to previous relationships with similar characteristics;
> reviewing the correspondence held with the NPO Beneficiary, their representatives and relevant associate NPOs, then considering if the proposed relationship makes sense based on what they have said.
- 50. Where a NPO Beneficiary is a group of persons, for example refugees from a war zone, there is no requirement to obtain a confirmation for each individual person. The Prescribed NPO should still take account of the characteristics of the group of NPO Beneficiaries when preparing its NPO PRA (or equivalent).
- 51. In these cases, the Prescribed NPO may demonstrate compliance with the Prescribed NPO Order by taking measures to ensure the group of persons are legitimate NPO Beneficiaries. This may be achieved by, for example:
> visiting the location where the NPO Funds will be applied and by considering whether the amount(s) to be applied appear to be reasonable given what is proposed to be done with them;
> considering if the amount(s) to be applied to the group of NPO Beneficiaries makes sense when compared to previous relationships with similar characteristics;
> reviewing the correspondence held with the group of NPO Beneficiaries, their representatives and relevant associate NPOs, then considering if the proposed business relationship or one-off transaction makes sense based on what they have said.
- 52. Based on the assessed risk of the relationship with the NPO Beneficiaries, one or more of the above measures may be appropriate.

## Overview

- 54. Article 6(2) of the Prescribed NPO Order defines an associate NPO as 'an NPO with which the Prescribed NPO collaborates or works jointly in carrying out its activities'. Associate NPOs may sometimes be referred to as 'Partners'.
- 55. An associate NPO might be based in Jersey, or they might be based elsewhere.
- 56. For the purposes of this NPO Handbook, a Prescribed NPO establishes a relationship with its associate NPOs.
- 57. To comply with the Prescribed NPO Order, a Prescribed NPO will need to apply a level of due diligence to its associate NPOs.
- 58. Prescribed NPOs should refer to their NPO PRA (or equivalent) and use their judgement to determine how much identity information needs to be obtained in each case, and how that information should be verified.
- 59. The Prescribed NPO is expected to make this decision by applying a risk-based approach, making reference to its risk appetite statement, documenting its decision-making and keeping it under regular review.

### CD regulated TCSP guidance

- 60. Where a Prescribed NPO is receiving services from a CD regulated TCSP and it is considered appropriate to do so, the NPO may choose to apply due diligence measures which are aligned with those set out in sections 3 and 4 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook.
<!--
rule_type: guidance
applies_to: all
-->

## Guidance notes -Identifying an associate NPO

- 61. Where an associate NPO is a natural person, a Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that it has taken reasonable measures to identify that associate NPO where it obtains the following information:
> Name;
> Date of birth (if possible);
> Country of birth;
> Current area of residence;
> Principal area of operations.
- 62. Where an associate NPO is a legal person (such as a company) or a legal arrangement (such as a trust), a Prescribed NPO should obtain the following information:
> date of incorporation or establishment;
> country of incorporation or establishment;
> principal area of operations;
> names of the associate NPO Controllers, e.g., board members or trustees.
- 63. Identity information may be obtained directly from the associate NPO, or their representative.
- 64. The amount of identity information obtained may differ through the taking of a risk-based approach, based on the outcome of the NPO PRA and the NPO's risk appetite statement. For example, where the NPO PRA produces a higher risk outcome the Prescribed NPO may wish to also obtain the names of the associate NPO's owners, e.g., shareholders or partners of a partnership arrangement.

## Guidance notes -Nature and purpose of relationship

- 65. A Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that it has obtained information on the nature and purpose of a relationship where it requests and documents this information at the establishment of a relationship.
- 66. The 'nature' of a relationship may include:
> the type of activity the associate NPO will undertake on behalf of the Prescribed NPO, e.g., delivering medical supplies to a disaster area;


> how that activity is intended to be carried out, e.g., the associate NPO will utilise its fleet of heavy-duty vehicles.
- 67. The 'purpose' of a relationship may include:
> the reason the Prescribed NPO is engaging with the associate NPO, e.g., the associate NPO is able to access areas of a country which, for security reasons, the Prescribed NPO is otherwise unable to reach.

## Guidance notes -Confirming associate NPOs are not involved in terrorism

- 68. A Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that it has taken reasonable measures to confirm an associate NPO is not assisting, or being used to assist, terrorism/the financing of terrorism where it does so use robust, independent data sources.
- 69. Based on the outcome of the NPO PRA, a greater or lesser level of measures may be necessary to mitigate the risk of the associate NPO being involved in terrorist financing. However, Prescribed NPOs should always include the following checks in their due diligence measures relating to associate NPOs :
> screening against the UK and Jersey lists of Proscribed terrorist organisations ;
> screening against the UNSC Consolidated List; and
> the OFSI Consolidated sanctions list and the UK sanctions list.
- 70. A Prescribed NPO may undertake screening in respect of sanctions through several different methods. These should be tailored so they are appropriate to its size and complexity. Examples may include:
> a Prescribed NPO which is receiving services from a CD regulated TCSP might utilise a screening program developed by a professional due diligence firm to which the service provider already has access;
> if checks which substantively achieve what is set out in paragraphs 90 and 91 above have recently been carried out by the Prescribed NPO 's service provider in compliance with its requirements under sections 3 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook, it is not necessary for the service provider to repeat them;
> where a Prescribed NPO is small and individuals participate on a part-time/voluntary basis, the checks may be carried out by a person directly accessing the above-referenced lists and searching for the required names via the 'Find' function of their internet browser.
- 71. The Prescribed NPO needs to be cognisant that when undertaking screening, it is important to remember that the connection to sanctioned/designated persons and proscribed terrorist organisations is more likely to be hidden, meaning that the person the NPO is engaging with is not necessarily directly captured in the lists the Prescribed NPO is checking against. Instead, they may be indirectly captured via their associations with terrorist s, which may not be immediately apparent, but which can be brought to light through undertaking additional enquiries.
- 72. The independent data sources used should seek to confirm that the associate NPO is a legitimate person or operation. Set out below are some examples of due diligence which may be carried out at different levels of risk. The Prescribed NPO should document its decision in each case regarding how much due diligence it has decided to undertake:
> Lower risk:
- o obtaining details of the legal person or arrangement from an online registry;
- o seeking references from other NPOs to corroborate the information the associate NPO has provided;
- o undertaking an open-source check (e.g., Google) to ascertain if the associate NPO has been subject to any adverse media coverage.

## › Medium risk

- o review of registration documentation;
- o understanding how long an associate NPO has been operating, e.g. has it been set up 'overnight' to capitalise on a market opportunity?

## › Higher risk

- o inspecting the associate NPO's site of operations to view their activities first-hand (or commissioning a trusted third party to do so);
- o inspections of associate NPO records and financial statements;
- o requesting details of their antiDiversion systems and controls and testing them.
- 73. There may be circumstances where a Prescribed NPO has a long-term relationship with an associate NPO. In this scenario, they may consider that additional verification of the associate NPO's identity, as set out above, is not required. If the NPO takes this decision, they should ensure their rationale for undertaking no further verification is documented. An example is set out below:
> a Prescribed NPO in Jersey provides monetary aid to several rural communities in a foreign country. The NPO Funds are sent to their associate NPO, where a local faith leader is responsible for ensuring NPO Funds are distributed where they are most needed, to legitimate NPO Beneficiaries. The Prescribed NPO has worked with the associate NPO for over a decade and several members of the Governing body have met with the local faith leader personally. Through this relationship, they are satisfied that the faith leader is a respectable person of good standing. The Prescribed NPO considers that no further verification is required. The Governing body records their rationale at the next general meeting.
- 74. To help mitigate terrorist financing risk, a Prescribed NPO may wish to consider putting a partnership agreement in place to govern the relationship with the associate NPO. This agreement might include certain clauses to ensure a strong CFT framework is put together and maintained. Example clauses include:
> an explanation of what terrorist financing and Diversion is;
> an undertaking that the associate NPO has appropriate measures in place to mitigate the risks of terrorist financing, and commits the associate NPO, on a best endeavours basis, to preventing it from occurring;
> permitting the Prescribed NPO to request whatever information is necessary from the associate NPO to satisfy its due diligence requirements;
> agreeing to the Prescribed NPO carrying out spot-checks on the activities of the associate NPO or its representative. Where a physical visit is not possible due to, for example, safety concerns, other measures of verification may be permitted such as video calls, requesting copies of invoices etc.;
> requiring the associate NPO to maintain an audit trail of its activities and provide it to the Prescribed NPO upon request (may also extend to formal financial records);
> the Prescribed NPO reserving the right to terminate the business relationship or one-off transaction should the outcome of any checks be unsatisfactory, or if it is identified that Diversion has taken place.
- 75. There may be circumstances where a Prescribed NPO concludes that it is not possible, nor necessary, to put a partnership agreement, or one with CFT clauses, in place. If this is the case, the NPO should be able to explain why they took that decision and how they consider the risk of Diversion to be mitigated without a partnership agreement, or CFT clauses, being in place.

## 5.2.1.1 Exceptional circumstances

## Guidance notes

- 76. There may be exceptional circumstances where a relationship with an associate NPO may need to be established or carried out rapidly. An example may be a humanitarian disaster, like a flood or earthquake which cuts off a community from food and water. Such disasters require an urgent response. Undertaking due diligence at the outset of the relationship in the way that would otherwise be expected is likely to be inappropriate.
- 77. Of course, this does not mean that Prescribed NPOs should undertake a lesser level of due diligence compared to where the need is less urgent. A Prescribed NPO which intends to operate in emergency scenarios will need to demonstrate they are prepared and able to implement effective controls when engaging associate NPOs for this purpose.
- 78. A Prescribed NPO may therefore demonstrate compliance with Article 6 of the Prescribed NPO Order where it:
> establishes and maintains effective procedures governing how it will identify and engage appropriate associate NPOs in any given scenario;
> undertakes as much due diligence at the outset as can be done without unduly delaying the establishment of the relationship; and
> undertakes the remaining checks deemed appropriate by the NPO PRA as soon as possible following the commencement of the relationship, e.g., whilst the associate NPO is operating 'on the ground' in the local area where distributions are carried out.
- 79. Where the above approach has been taken, a Prescribed NPO should clearly document its rationale for applying this exception and set out a timeframe during which the remaining checks will be carried out and such allowances should also be documented in its NPO risk appetite statement.
- 80. The Prescribed NPO should consider including a clause in its partnership agreement whereby it reserves the right to terminate the relationship should the outcome of the checks be unsatisfactory.
- 81. Equally, a Prescribed NPO may consider utilising a 'preferred partner' /associate NPO which has already been through the due diligence process before the exceptional event occurs.

## 5.3 NPO donors

## Statutory requirements (paraphrased wording)

- 82. Article 5 of the Prescribed NPO Order requires a Prescribed NPO to keep records of donors who, during the preceding 12 months, have donated (as a single donation or cumulatively) -
- i) £10,000 or above; or
- ii) over 50% of total donations made to the Prescribed NPO during that period.
<!--
rule_type: general_info
applies_to: all
-->

## Overview

- 83. Donations to Prescribed NPOs are diverse. For example, a significant contribution made by a wealthy individual or institution, or a small monthly contribution made by a member of the public.
- 84. For the purposes of this NPO Handbook, the relationship between a Prescribed NPO and its donors is not considered to constitute a business relationship or one-off transaction.
- 85. As noted above, Article 5 of the Prescribed NPO Order requires Prescribed NPOs to keep a record of ' significant donor s', i.e., those falling within Article 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(b) of the Prescribed NPO Order.
- 86. To comply with the Prescribed NPO Order, a Prescribed NPO will need to apply a level of due diligence to its significant donors.
- 87. Prescribed NPOs should refer to their NPO PRA and their risk appetite statement (or equivalent documents) and use their judgement to determine how much identity information needs to be obtained in each case to mitigate the risk of Diversion.
- 88. There is no requirement in the Prescribed NPO Order to verify the identity information collected for significant donors. However, in some circumstances, such as when the NPO PRA (or equivalent) produces a higher-risk outcome, the Prescribed NPO may consider it necessary to do so. In these cases, the NPO should utilise robust, independent data sources to confirm the significant donor is a legitimate person or operation -see the guidance in section5.2 of the NPO Handbook.

## CD regulated TCSP guidance

- 89. Where a Prescribed NPO is receiving services from a CD regulated TCSP and it is considered appropriate to do so, the NPO may choose to apply due diligence measures which are aligned with those set out in sections 3 and 4 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook.
- 90. For the avoidance of doubt, there is no statutory or Code of Practice requirement to make the identities of any significant donors public, for example via a Prescribed NPO 's annual financial statement.
<!--
rule_type: guidance
applies_to: all
-->

## Guidance notes -Identifying significant donors

- 91. Where a significant donor is a natural person, a Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that it has taken reasonable measures to identify that person where it obtains the following information:
> Name;
> Date of birth;
> Country of birth;
> Current residential address.
- 92. Where a significant donor is a legal person (such as a company) or a legal arrangement (such as a trust), a Prescribed NPO should obtain the following information:
> date of incorporation or establishment;
> country of incorporation or establishment;
> registered address;
> names of the significant donor 's controllers, e.g., board members or trustees;
> names of the significant donor 's owners, e.g., shareholders or partners of a partnership arrangement.
- 93. Information collected on significant donors may be kept in a register, list, or similar format.
- 94. As noted above, it may be considered necessary to obtain additional identity information based on the outcome of the NPO PRA and the NPO's risk appetite statement (or equivalent documents). For example, a higher-risk rating might mean the Prescribed NPO requests further information from their significant donors.
- 95. Based on the outcome of the NPO PRA and the NPO's risk appetite statement (or equivalent documents), and where a significant donor is not a natural person, it may be considered necessary to understand the ownership structure of that significant donor and the persons who control it. For example, a Prescribed NPO may consider it necessary where a higher-risk rating is produced. In these situations, Prescribed NPOs should follow the guidance set out in the relevant sections of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook listed below, in respect of identifying beneficial owners and controllers:
> Trusts -section 4.4.1 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook ;
> Limited Partnerships -section 4.4.3 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook ;
> Companies -section 4.5.1 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook ;
> Foundations -section 4.5.3 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook ;
> Partnerships -section 4.5.5 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook.
- 96. When reviewing these sections, a Prescribed NPO should consider the term ' customer ' to refer to NPO Beneficiaries.
- 97. Where a significant donor makes regular payments to a Prescribed NPO, it is not necessary to obtain identity information every time a donation is received from that donor. In these cases, Prescribed NPOs should seek to reconfirm the donor's identity information at least every two years. The re-confirmation should be undertaken sooner where it is known that there has been a change in the significant donor 's information, e.g., a natural person has changed residential address, or the board of a corporate significant donor has changed.

## 6 IDENTIFICATION, SCREENING AND TRAINING OF RELEVANT VOLUNTEERS, RELEVANT EMPLOYEES, OWNERS AND CONTROLLERS
<!--
rule_type: general_info
applies_to: all
-->

## 6.1 Overview of section

- 98. Prescribed NPOs also have a specific legal requirement to maintain certain information on their NPO Owners and/or Controllers. This section sets out the statutory requirements and provides guidance on how Prescribed NPOs may demonstrate compliance with those requirements.
- 99. This section also provides guidance on how a Prescribed NPO might carry out due diligence on, and provide training to, certain volunteers and employees.
- 100. The presence of competent individuals, who are well-trained and have integrity, will assist Prescribed NPOs to maintain effective systems and controls to counter terrorist financing.
- 101. The NPO Handbook does not require Prescribed NPOs to carry out screening or training through mandatory Code of Practice requirements.

## 6.2 Identifying NPO Owners and/or Controllers
<!--
rule_type: statutory
applies_to: prescribed_npo
-->

## Statutory requirements (paraphrased wording)

- 102. Article 4 of the Prescribed NPO Order requires a Prescribed NPO to keep records that are sufficient to identify:
- (a) any person who owns the NPO, or controls or directs the NPO's activities, including as appropriate, a senior officer, board member, director or trustee; and
- (b) any other person who exercises, or has the right to exercise, significant influence or control over the activities of the NPO.
<!--
rule_type: general_info
applies_to: all
-->

## Overview

- 103. As noted in the Glossary of the NPO Handbook, for the purposes of the Handbook ' NPO Owners and/or Controllers ' are those persons set out in Articles 4(1)(a) and 4(1)(b) of the Prescribed NPO Order.
- 104. Examples of NPO Owners include, but are not limited to:
> Shareholders; and
> Partners of a partnership.
- 105. Depending on the legal form of a Prescribed NPO, it may not have any NPO Owners. An example would be a NPO established as a trust. NPOs established in such a way are not required to comply with that element of Article 4(1)(a) of the Prescribed NPO Order, nor apply any of the below measures in respect of NPO Owners.
- 106. NPO Controllers will include charity governors, board members, trustees, and senior officers (or equivalent, whether or not they are remunerated).
- 107. It is important to emphasise that remuneration is irrelevant when considering if a person is an NPO Controller. The test is whether that person can exercise control over, or direct, the activities of the Prescribed NPO.
- 108. It is possible for an individual to be considered a NPO Owner or NPO Controller where they hold their ownership interest or exercise control through indirect means. For example:
> where a Prescribed NPO is established as a company, an individual who holds shares in the NPO through an intermediate holding vehicle will be considered a NPO Owner ;
> an individual who does not sit on the Governing body of the NPO, but in accordance with whose directions the Governing body are nevertheless accustomed to act will be a NPO Controller.

## Guidance notes

- 109. A Prescribed NPO may demonstrate compliance with Article 4 of the Prescribed NPO Order where it obtains the following information from each NPO Owner and Controller :
> Name;
> Date of birth;
> Place of birth;
> Permanent residential address;
> The capacity in which they are acting, e.g., a board member, shareholder etc.
- 110. Where any of the information set out above changes, e.g., the NPO Owner or Controller moves to a new permanent residence, the Prescribed NPO should update the information held in their records.
- 111. A Prescribed NPO may wish to consider requiring its NPO Owners and/or Controllers to make a periodic confirmation that the information held on file remains correct.

## 6.3 Screening of relevant volunteers, relevant employees and NPO Controllers
<!--
rule_type: general_info
applies_to: all
-->

## Overview

- 112. As noted in section 6.1 of this NPO Handbook, this section is provided as guidance on best practice. There are no mandatory Code of Practice requirements set out in this section.
- 113. For the purposes of this section, the term ' relevant employees ' means an individual who is working under a contract of employment and undertakes one or more of the following as part of their role:
> Acts as a NPO Controller ; and/or
> Is responsible for the disbursement, and/or raising, of NPO Funds outside of Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, England and Wales, or Scotland.
- 114. It includes temporary and contract employees, and the employee of any external party fulfilling a function in relation to a Prescribed NPO under an outsourcing agreement.
- 115. For the purposes of this section, the term 'relevant volunteer' means an individual who carries out their duties for a Prescribed NPO on a voluntary, non-remunerated basis, and undertakes one or more of the following as part of their role:
> Acts as a NPO Controller ; and/or
> Is responsible for the disbursement, and/or raising, of NPO Funds outside of Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, England and Wales, or Scotland.
- 116. Examples of roles where an individual is responsible for the disbursement, and/or raising, of NPO Funds may include:
> researching and recommending regions, or NPO Beneficiaries, where NPO Funds should be disbursed;
> approving and/or executing a transaction which disburses NPO Funds to outside of Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, England and Wales, or Scotland, whether electronically or through the handing over of cash in the field.
- 117. It is expected that the terms 'relevant employee ' and 'relevant volunteer' will, between them, capture all NPO Controller s.
- 118. NPO Owners are not subject to the requirements set out below.
<!--
rule_type: guidance
applies_to: all
-->

## Guidance notes

- 119. A Prescribed NPO may wish to screen their NPO Controllers against:
> the UK and Jersey lists of Proscribed terrorist organisations ;
> screening against the UNSC Consolidated List; and
> the OFSI Consolidated sanctions list and the UK sanctions list.
- 120. A Prescribed NPO may undertake screening in respect of sanctions through several different methods. These should be tailored so they are appropriate to its size and complexity. Examples may include:
> a Prescribed NPO which is receiving services from a CD regulated TCSP might utilise a screening program developed by a professional due diligence firm to which the service provider already has access;
> if checks which are substantively the same as those described at paragraph 141 above have recently been carried out by the Prescribed NPO 's service provider in compliance with their requirements at section 9.2 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook, it is not necessary for the service provider to repeat them;
> where a Prescribed NPO is small and individuals participate on a part-time/voluntary basis, the checks may be carried out by a person directly accessing the above-referenced lists and searching for the required names via the 'Find' function of their internet browser.
- 121. In addition to completing the checks listed at paragraph 141 above, a Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that its relevant volunteers and relevant employees are screened where it does one or more of the following, as appropriate for the nature of the relevant volunteer or relevant employee 's role and responsibilities, and on a risk-based approach:
> obtains and confirms references provided;
> obtains and confirms employment history and qualifications disclosed;
> obtains details of any regulatory action taken against the individual (or absence of such action);
> obtains and confirms details of any criminal convictions (or absence of such convictions).
- 122. Enquiries into an individual's criminal past are required to be subject to the Rehabilitation of Offenders (Jersey) Law 2001, which prevents supervised persons from requesting information from its directors, senior managers and other employees (and prospective directors, senior managers and other employees) about convictions that are "spent", except where provided for by the Rehabilitation of Offenders (Exceptions) (Jersey) Regulations 2002.
- 123. A Prescribed NPO may also wish to consider requiring its relevant employee s, relevant volunteers and all NPO Controller s to make a signed confirmation that they are not, nor have ever been, members of a Proscribed terrorist organisation.
- 124. It may also be appropriate for any contract or agreement issued to a relevant volunteer, relevant employee or NPO Controller to include a clause stating that non-compliance with policies and procedures, or evidence the person may have been involved in terrorist financing, will lead to disciplinary processes.

## 6.4 Training and awareness of relevant volunteers, relevant employees and NPO Controllers

## 6.4.1.1 Promoting awareness and providing training
<!--
rule_type: guidance
applies_to: all
-->

## Guidance notes

- 125. As noted in section 6.1 of this NPO Handbook, this section is provided as guidance on best practice. There are no mandatory Code of Practice requirements set out in this section.
- 126. Where a Prescribed NPO decides to provide training to its relevant volunteers and relevant employee s (which should include all NPO Controllers), such training should cover:
> the specific terrorist financing risks to which the Prescribed NPO may be exposed; and
> how it might be abused for terrorist financing purposes.
- 127. The overall objective of the training delivered should be to promote an antiDiversion culture within the Prescribed NPO.
- 128. When designing the training, the Prescribed NPO should ensure it is relevant to any NPO PRA, Diversion risk register and risk appetite statement (or their equivalents) which they have prepared. It should also be tailored so it is specific to the person(s) receiving the training.
- 129. The training may include guidance on specific red flags and risk indicators which are relevant to the Prescribed NPO 's programme of activity. They may include, but are not limited to:
> anomalies in the NPO programme delivery, e.g., unusual events, or meetings/ relationships which are not expected;
> transactions with unexpected parties, where the transactions do not make sense;
> behaviours that indicate a party may be sympathising with a terrorist organisation or having extremist/radicalised views;
> high turnover of staff in an associate NPO or the Prescribed NPO itself;
> non-compliance with procedures by NPO staff, or frequent management overrides;
> the ability of an associate NPO to gain access to an area when other associate NPOs /nongovernmental organisations cannot do so;
> failure of associate NPOs, NPO Beneficiaries or their representatives to comply in a timely manner with reasonable requests for information or documentation;
> incomplete records of donation delivery by NPO staff or associate NPOs ;
> NPO branded donation items appear in local markets;
> vague records of expenses without additional specification in accounts and supporting documentation, e.g. references to 'logistics', 'security', 'miscellaneous'.
- 130. The training may also include reference to the JFSC 's whistleblowing line -see our website for more information.
- 131. Materials which may be useful in the delivery of training may include:
> publications by academics and the Government of Jersey, such as the NPO NRA ;
> guidance documents regarding terrorist financing and sanctions published by JFSC ;
> Additional information sources attached as Appendices to the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook.
- 132. Examples of the different types of training which may be delivered to relevant volunteers and relevant employee s include:
> A Prescribed NPO is designing training for a relevant volunteer who will travel to a region of a higher-risk jurisdiction with significant levels of local government corruption and lawlessness. The relevant volunteer will be responsible for handing out NPO Funds to be used in the local area, in collaboration with some associate NPOs. The NPO considers that it is important for the training to cover specific warning signs when physically working with associate NPOs in the region and what to do if unusual events occur such as meetings or relationships which are not expected;
> A Prescribed NPO raises NPO Funds in Jersey and disburses them to a small associate NPOs which helps disadvantaged young people abroad. The NPO considers that it is important for the relevant volunteers and relevant employee s to be trained on general warning signs when working with associate NPOs, such as incomplete records of donation delivery.
- 133. It is important for training to be delivered at appropriate frequencies, for example:
> induction training to be delivered within 10 working days of the commencement of employment (or its equivalent) and, if appropriate, where there is a material change in an individual's role and responsibilities;
> refresher training to be delivered on a regular basis. This may be annually, or at some other frequency deemed appropriate based on the Prescribed NPO 's NPO PRA or equivalent document.

## 6.4.1.2 Monitoring and maintaining awareness

## Overview

- 134. As noted in section 6.1 of this NPO Handbook, this section is provided as guidance on best practice. There are no mandatory Code of Practice requirements set out in this section.
- 135. As time passes, the level of awareness of terrorist financing risks can decrease. Having a framework in place to maintain a high level of awareness can keep a Prescribed NPO 's defences against Diversion in good condition.
- 136. Where a Prescribed NPO delivers training to relevant volunteers and relevant employee s (see section 6.1 of this NPO Handbook), they should monitor and test their relevant volunteers' and relevant employee s' (including all NPO Controllers') level of awareness of terrorist financing risks.

## Guidance notes

- 137. A Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that it monitors and tests their volunteers', employees' and NPO Controllers' level of awareness where it periodically tests the awareness of:
> terrorist financing risks;
> the Prescribed NPO 's policies and procedures ; and
> relevant statutory obligations.
- 138. Where awareness is deemed to be insufficient, the Prescribed NPO should take action to remedy the situation as soon as practicable.
- 139. When a relevant volunteer's, relevant employee s, or NPO Controller's contract with a Prescribed NPO comes to an end, it may be appropriate for the Prescribed NPO to conduct an exit interview. The interview could seek feedback on any training and monitoring the person received and how it may be improved.
- 140. Factors which may influence whether a Prescribed NPO considers an exit interview to be necessary may include:
> the level of risk assessed in the Prescribed NPO 's NPO PRA (or equivalent), e.g., if the NPO PRA generates a higher risk level, it may be appropriate for all relevant volunteers and relevant employee s involved in that particular NPO programme of work to have an exit interview;
> the level of terrorist financing risk which the individual's role involved.

## 7 ACCOUNTING FOR FUNDS
<!--
rule_type: statutory
applies_to: prescribed_npo
-->

## Statutory requirements (paraphrased wording)

- 141. Article 2(1) of the Prescribed NPO Order requires a Prescribed NPO to prepare annually a financial statement for a period of not more than 12 months.
- 142. Article 2(2) states that the period referenced above:
- (a) must begin on or before the date the NPO became a Prescribed NPO (e.g., if the NPO became a Prescribed NPO on 15 March 2023, the period must begin on or before 15 March 2023); but
- (b) if the NPO has previously prepared and provided a financial statement under paragraph (1), the period must begin at the end of the period covered by its most recent financial statement.
- 143. Article 2(3) states that the financial statement must be in a form published or approved for the purpose by the JFSC.
- 144. Article 2(4) states that a Prescribed NPO must provide a financial statement prepared under paragraph (1) to the JFSC if required to do so by the JFSC.
- 145. Article 3 of the Prescribed NPO Order requires Prescribed NPOs to have in place appropriate accounting systems and controls to ensure that its funds are fully accounted for.
<!--
rule_type: code_of_practice
applies_to: prescribed_npo
-->

## NPO Codes of Practice

[NPO5] A Prescribed NPO must maintain accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain its transactions. The accounting records must:

> disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the NPO at that time; and
> enable the Prescribed NPO to verify that funds have been received and spent in a manner consistent with the purpose and objectives of the Prescribed NPO.
<!--
rule_type: guidance
applies_to: all
-->

## Guidance notes

146. A Prescribed NPO may demonstrate compliance with the NPO Code of Practice set out above by regularly reconciling their transactions. The frequency of reconciliation may be determined by reference to the NPO PRA and the NPO's risk appetite statement (or equivalent documents). For example, if the assessment outcome is 'higher risk', the accounting records are likely to be reconciled more regularly. If the assessment outcome is 'lower risk', it may be more appropriate to reconcil e less regularly.

- 147. The financial statement s' level of complexity will depend on the nature and scale of a Prescribed NPO 's operations, as well as their type. For example:
> a small organisation with a relatively simple and low level of activity may consider it sufficient to prepare a statement of income and expenditure;
> NPO s may be subject to other, at times more stringent, requirements depending on their type. For example, NPO s may be subject to the requirements of the Companies Law.

148. A Prescribed NPO may wish to consider presenting its financial statements for approval by its Governing body, e.g., its trustees, board of directors etc. The Governing body considers whether the financial statements represent a true and accurate reflection of the Prescribed NPO 's financial position and record their decision on the same.

## 8 RECORD-KEEPING

## 8.1 Overview and general requirements
<!--
rule_type: guidance
applies_to: all
-->

## Overview

- 149. This section supplements the statutory provisions of the Prescribed NPO Order relevant to record-keeping with additional NPO Codes of Practice and Guidance notes so that Prescribed NPOs may demonstrate compliance with the legal requirements. More general obligations on Prescribed NPOs to maintain records (such as those in other Jersey laws) are not addressed in this section. It should be noted, however, that such general obligations may extend the period for which records must be kept.
- 150. Record-keeping is essential to facilitate effective oversight and monitoring supervision by the JFSC and, where necessary, effective investigation by law enforcement. Good record-keeping helps a Prescribed NPO to demonstrate compliance with their statutory and NPO Code of Practice requirements, as well as assisting law enforcement in tracing funds which may have been used to finance terrorism through the financial system.
- 151. Where the financial statement s of a Prescribed NPO are audited, records also provide context for any opinion which may be issued on the financial statements by the Prescribed NPO 's auditor.
- 152. Records can be kept in the following forms:
> original documents;
> copies of original documents (certified where appropriate);
> scanned copies; or
> computerised/electronic copies.

### CD regulated TCSP guidance

- 153. Where a Prescribed NPO is receiving services from a CD regulated TCSP it is likely that recordkeeping measures will already in place to meet the requirements of section 10 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook. Where these measures substantively meet the requirements set out throughout Section 8 of this NPO Handbook, it is not necessary for the service provider to duplicate them.

## Statutory requirements (paraphrased wording)

- 154. Article 4(2) of the Prescribed NPO Order requires Prescribed NPOs to retain records kept under Article 4(1) (owners, controllers etc) for at least 5 years.
- 155. Article 5(3) of the Prescribed NPO Order requires Prescribed NPOs to retain records kept under Article 5(1) (significant donors) for at least 5 years.

## NPO Codes of Practice

[NPO6] A Prescribed NPO must keep, for a period of at least five years, copies of their annual financial statement s and the underlying accounting records.

[NPO7] A Prescribed NPO must keep, for a period of at least five years, copies of any:
> NPO PRAs;
> Risk appetite statements; and

<!--
rule_type: code_of_practice
applies_to: prescribed_npo
-->

## NPO Codes of Practice

[NPO12] A Prescribed NPO must keep documents, data or information obtained when establishing a business relationship in a way that facilitates on-going monitoring of the NPO programme.

[NPO13] All records kept by a Prescribed NPO must be readily accessible and retrievable by the Prescribed NPO. Unless otherwise specified, records relating to a relationship with a NPO Beneficiary or associate NPO must be accessible and retrievable within five working days (whether kept in or outside of Jersey), or such longer period as agreed with the JFSC. Other records must be accessible and retrievable within 10 working days (whether kept in or outside of Jersey), or such longer period as agreed with the JFSC.

[NPO14] A Prescribed NPO must periodically review the condition of paper and electronic records and consider the adequacy of its record-keeping arrangements. The frequency of said reviews must be determined with reference to its NPO PRA (or equivalent).

[NPO15] A Prescribed NPO must periodically test procedures regarding access to and retrieval of its records. The frequency of said testing must be determined with reference to its NPO PRA (or equivalent).

[NPO16] Records must be maintained in a readable format. Where records are kept other than in readable form, they must be maintained such that they can be produced in readable form at a computer terminal in Jersey.

[NPO17] When original documents that would ordinarily have been destroyed are requested for investigation purposes, a Prescribed NPO must ascertain whether the documents have in fact been destroyed.

[NPO18] All documents (or parts thereof) held under the requirements of the Prescribed NPO Order and/or the NPO Codes of Practice in section 8 of this NPO Handbook must be understandable (i.e., in a language understood by a relevant volunteer or relevant employee of the Prescribed NPO) and must be translated into English at the request of the JFSC or any other authority which by law has the power to request them.

## 8.3 External records

## Overview

156. Where records are kept by another person (whether they are part of the Prescribed NPO 's group or otherwise), or kept outside Jersey, such as under an outsourcing or storage arrangement, this will present additional factors for a Prescribed NPO to consider. Regardless of the particular circumstances, the Prescribed NPO remains responsible for compliance with all record-keeping requirements.
<!--
rule_type: code_of_practice
applies_to: prescribed_npo
-->

## NPO Codes of Practice

[NPO19] A Prescribed NPO must not:

> allow another person (group or otherwise) to keep records; or
> keep records outside Jersey,

where access and retrieval of records (by that person, the JFSC and/or law enforcement) is likely to be impeded by confidentiality or data protection restrictions.

## 8.4 Reorganisation or termination
<!--
rule_type: general_info
applies_to: all
-->

## Overview

- 157. Record-keeping requirements persist and are unaffected where a Prescribed NPO :
> merges with another organisation;
> continues as another organisation, e.g., changing from being incorporated under the laws of one jurisdiction to another;
> is taken over by another organisation;
> is subject to internal reorganisation, e.g., the Prescribed NPO changes its internal divisions and amends their scope/remit;
> terminates its activities;
> transfers responsibility for a portion of their NPO Beneficiaries or donors to another organisation; or
> transfers contracts or arrangements with associate NPOs to another organisation.

## NPO Codes of Practice

[NPO20] A Prescribed NPO that undergoes mergers, continuance, takeovers or internal reorganisations, must ensure that records remain readily accessible and retrievable for the required periods stated above. This extends to the rationalising of computer systems and storage arrangements.

[NPO21] Record-keeping arrangements must be agreed with the JFSC where a Prescribed NPO:

> terminates its activities;
> transfers responsibility for a portion of their NPO Beneficiaries, or donors to another organisation; or
> transfers contracts or arrangements with associate NPOs to another organisation.

## 8.5 Suspicious Activity Reporting
<!--
rule_type: general_info
applies_to: all
-->

## Overview

- 158. In terms of the Terrorism law, all NPOs are required to submit Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) to the FIU. This section provides guidance on the process and production of SARs.
- 159. A suspicious activity report (SAR) is the format by which knowledge/belief, suspicion, or reasonable grounds for suspicion of money laundering and terrorist financing are reported.
- 160. A SAR allows information and intelligence to be formally passed to law enforcement agencies- helping them prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute crime.
- 161. A SAR must be filed with the FIU and not the Jersey Financial Services Commission.
<!--
rule_type: statutory
applies_to: prescribed_npo
-->

## Statutory Requirements (paraphrased wording)

- 162. Article 39 of the NPO Law states that in its application to NPOs, Article 19 of the Terrorism Law shall have effect as if in Article 19(1)(b) 'employment' included work undertaken on behalf of an NPO on a voluntary or an unpaid basis.
- 163. If a Prescribed NPO receives services from a CD regulated TCSP - the relevant person (the TCSP) and employees of the relevant person are subject to the obligations to report money laundering under Article 34D(4) of the Proceeds of Crime Law. See Section 8 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook.

## Guidance notes

- 164. A SAR should only be used to make reports where money laundering, terrorist financing or any property that constitutes or represents proceeds of criminal conduct is suspected or where property is intended to be used in criminal conduct. For other crimes a report should be made to the police.
- 165. A SAR must be reported via the FIU secure online submission service (PolSAR). A user guide can be found in the Help section on the PolSAR portal once logged in and should be used to review the form prior to submission.
- 166. A flow chart providing an overview of the SAR process is on the JFSC website.
